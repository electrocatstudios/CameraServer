# CameraServer
Raspberry Pi project for taking images with the camera module and serving them

# Architecture 

There are three components - one captures the images (the Camera folder), the processor (Processor) which keeps the number of files in check and the server (Server) which allows local access to the latest image. 

# Work in Progress

The project is still in development - updated docs coming soon.
