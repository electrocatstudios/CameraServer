# CameraServer
Raspberry Pi project for taking images with the camera module and serving them

# Architecture 

There are three components - one captures the images (the Camera folder), the processor (Processor) which keeps the number of files in check and the server (Server) which allows local access to the latest image. Eventually all three strands will be combined into a single application but for development purposes they are being treated separately.

# Work in Progress

The project is still in development - updated docs coming soon.
